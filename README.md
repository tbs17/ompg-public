## Compiling

### Linux

In Linux, navigate to the *scripts* folder and run

```
./cmake_init.sh
```

followed by

```
./cmake_build.sh.
```

The pretzel executable binary will be located in the CMakeBuild folder.

### Windows

In Windows, navigate to the *vstudio* folder and open the solution (.sln) in Visual Studio 2017 (or later) and then press *ctrl+shift+b* to compile.


## Usage

Proteins are modeled in 4 sequential stages

1. Fragment library generation
2. Multi-loop generation
3. Multi-loop clustering
4. Relaxation and topological gating state assignment

All scripts assume the compiled pretzel executable binary has been copied to the base project directory!

### Fragment library generation

Prior to multi-loop modeling, all single loops must have their fragment libraries generated using pretzel.

For scripts demonstrating fragment library generation as used in JACS paper, please see [scripts/a_frag_lib](scripts/a_frag_lib).

All scripts are prefixed in the order in which they should be run.

### Multi-loop generation

Once fragment libraries are available, all loops structures may be simultaneously modeled using pretzel.

For scripts demonstrating full multi-loop modeling, please see [scripts/b_multi_loop](scripts/b_multi_loop).

### Multi-loop clustering

To approximate uniform coverage over the geometric space of loops, pretzel sampling bias must be removed.

This is currently done by clustering the multi-loop samples using a streaming affinity propagation algorithm.

The source code for the clustering utility (*SCOBY*) is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/aperezrathke/scoby).

For scripts demonstrating clustering, please see [scripts/c_cluster](scripts/c_cluster).

All scripts assume the *SCOBY* binary is located in the base project folder.

### Relaxation and topological gating state assignment

To simulate a physical pH environment, the following steps are performed:

1. PROPKA is used to compute the pKa of each ionizable residue
2. NAMD is used to protonate residues with pKa > pH
3. NAMD is used to relax protons and all side chains
4. NAMD is used to compute energy of each relaxed loop conformation
5. CASTp is used to determine if relaxed loop conformation is in conducting state

Note that we have modified NAMD to facilitate capturing the energy state of each residue.

For scripts demonstrating relaxation and topological gating state assignment, please refer to [scripts/d_relax](scripts/d_relax).
